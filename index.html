    We weren’t the brightest, nor the highest rankers. We were a we from the time I can remember, me and my girlfriend. We’d be invited to parties as a couple, when we were asked to form a group for a project, we’d form a two person group. She was my family, one I’d never known. She didn’t care that I was an orphan and I didn’t think of her as an heir to a clothing empire.

    But sadly that wasn’t the case with her parents. They saw everything that she didn’t see. I was called an opportunist, a gold digger and a lot worse. When at 21 you hear these words, they hurt a lot more than they should. I needed her in my life and my aunt’s house wasn’t the place I wanted to set up my future with her. I had to let her go, she was the only good thing in my life and I didn’t want to bring her down into this mess. So I did what I had to do, I distanced myself from her.

She didn’t care that I was an orphan and I didn’t think of her as an heir to a clothing empire.

But sadly that wasn’t the case with her parents. They saw everything that she didn’t see. I was called an opportunist, a gold digger and a lot worse. When at 21 you hear these words, they hurt a lot more than they should. I needed her in my life and my aunt’s house wasn’t the place I wanted to set up my future with her. I had to let her go, she was the only good thing in my life and I didn’t want to bring her down into this mess. So I did what I had to do, I distanced myself from her.

I was frozen for a few months, neither her 400 missed calls nor her incessant messages made me come back to life.
I wish I could stand here and tell you that I strived and  became a CEO of my own firm, but I can tell you no such thing. I did become a corporate slave, I earn enough to live a comfortable life by myself and I did move out of the hell hole that was my aunt’s house, but I am nowhere close to what she deserves.

Yesterday she got married to a man who wasn’t me.
Today I am truly alone in this world, a feeling I never experienced in the 30 years of my existence, even though I was an orphan. But today I’m happy knowing that she’d never have to experience that feeling, because the man who sits before me signing a contract with my employer, has a framed picture of her on his desk and her smile tells me she’s exactly where she belongs.

 

3. Resolve is everything

There is a man I saw everyday for 14 years, selling bhel outside my house. He’d greet me with a smile, give me my regular Sukha Puri every evening and tell me ‘Thank You’! It intrigued me, I should be the one thanking him, but instead he’d do it first anyway. I never bothered asking him, after all what was it to me?

One day I was leaving for my usual 8 am routine, waiting for my shared auto, when I happened to look across the street, the middle aged Kaka, as I’d grown accustomed to calling him, wasn’t at his stall. I walked over and tried to see a sign saying why he wasn’t here already as he was every day, but I found none. I stopped thinking about it and ran towards my rickshaw.

But the whole day at work was a waste, I knew there was a story in there somewhere but I couldn’t see it.
Armed with my inquisitiveness, I went to his stall on my way home. To my surprise, there was a very pretty, tired woman working the stall.

I asked her, Aunty, aaj Kaka nahi aaye?

She smiled at me, beaming with pride and said, Nahi woh exam dene gaye hai’.

She was swamped with customers, so I didn’t question her further. From the next day, there was no stall, no sign of bhel and no Kaka.

Eventually, like everything mundane in life, I forgot about him.
It’s been 3 years since I thought about Kaka, so imagine my surprise when I picked up the newspaper and read ‘Bhel wala opens 80 schools across rural Maharashtra’. Now his smiling ‘Sukha Puri’ face pushes me to do better every single day.

Inspiration is everywhere, you just need to take the leap.

<P>hi as the website creator by the way my name is abdoul .I think is good to inspired many people as much as i can ,we are all passing throug a ruff moment in life 
    many people have lost there love ones and still cant bear the pain of loosing them,As the creator my self i have experience somany things in life.
    I personally decided to express the feeling of the mute voice ,why i use the words mute voice,is beacause they are in a situation no body can understand whats in there shoes 
    some are born with golden spoon and some are born with silver spoon,there are still people who are just worries about what to eat for the day,
    There is people in the world that can not afford just $1 to eat.
    Be greatfull for what ever you have.the fingers are not the same.
    If you wake up Breathing be thankfull for life even life is not <strong>Garanty</strong>
